# Research

A repository of research experiments with AI.

## Disclaimer

I am not an academic. In fact I was very bad at studying while at University.

There are plenty of reasons to not consider this type of research to be 'true research', but nonetheless I am documenting these experiments as they're part of my efforts to understand what I can use AI for, and sometimes the results are informative, both in that sense and in the sense of the content and results of the research itself.

I am, keeping in mind that the research results may be questioned by those with actual expertise in performing research and this is why I am attempting to document the research method, should I or anyone else wish to repeat the experiment (namely using AI to perform certain types of research).

YMMV, as the saying goes.
