# The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

In this research, I'm analysing the SDLC, its processes, document types and phases and how the industry has described this formally, via specifications and standards. Practitioners know how complex this is and that the different standards have caused many lengthy debates, but most of us feel that there are commonalities - at least when we're feeling open-minded.

My first prompt:

    I want to describe the software development lifecycle (SDLC) in abstract form, 
    specifically I want to enumerate and validate these elements:
    
    1. lifecycle processes (including but not necessarily limited to: Agreement, 
      Organisational, Technical Management, Technical)
    2. generic document types (including but not necessarily limited to: Description,
      Plan, Policy, Procedure, Report, Request, Specification)
    3. SDLC phases: (including but not necessarily limited to: Planning, Analysis,
      Design, Implementation, Testing, and Maintenance)

    Analyze formal specifications of the SDLC and derive a common abstraction, using each of these three elements.

This produced the following: [Validated SDLC Abstractions: Formal Standards Meet Industry Practice](./validated-sdlc-abstractions.md).

In the next prompt I sought a simplified view:

    OK, now let's create a simplified artefact that documents just the 4 groups of
    30 unified processes (perhaps a list of lists would be a good way of organising
    this), the 7 document types and 73 items, the essential phases (you may describe
    variants 5-7 separately for comparative purposes).

This resulted in: [Core SDLC Abstractions Reference](./core-sdlc-abstractions-reference.md).
